This git repository is intended for instructional purposes. It is the source code that accompanies a Rappid blog post "Integration with Angular" which can be found [here](https://resources.jointjs.com/tutorial/angular).

### Prerequisites  

To run the following code, you will need a [Rappid license](https://www.jointjs.com/license) that comes with the Rappid installable package file `rappid.tgz`.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- git

#### Setup

Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/NesrineSbouii/jointJsSample.git
```

Change into the `jointJsSample` directory.

```
cd jointJsSample
```

For this tutorial, you need to place your own `rappid.tgz` file in the root directory.

When that is completed, you can install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Your demo is now ready to start.

```
npm start
```

You should be able to view the demo at `http://localhost:4200`.
